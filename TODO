x Add eraser function to spectrogram module
	- needs testing
- Too many "magic numbers" for eraser sizes...
x Implement config file reading
	* offloaded to pyfex
	* fex only uses command line parameters
	* this makes porting across platforms easier
		* at least for me: I have no idea where a Win user would keep config files.
- Complete the python front end
	x Parse config (ini) file to pass CLI parameters to fex binary
	- Show file selection dialogs for chosing songs, and saving data
	- Make either UI agnostic, or seperate versions for GTK, QT, etc
		- Are there Win / Mac native python dialog APIs?
			- Or do these need to use GTK/QT or Tk/Wx/...
	- Need input from python coders (pull requests welcomed!)
