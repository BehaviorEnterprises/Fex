x Add eraser function to spectrogram module
	- needs testing
- Add log transformation to frequency?
- Add cursorFG to config.cpp and python code
- Too many "magic numbers" for eraser sizes...
x Implement config file reading
	* offloaded to pyfex
	* fex only uses command line parameters
	* this makes porting across platforms easier
		* at least for me: I have no idea where a Win user would keep config files.
