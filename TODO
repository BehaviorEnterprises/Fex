- eraser control (toggle on / off)
	- bring back "modes"?
x Add eraser function to spectrogram module
	- needs testing
- Too many "magic numbers" for eraser sizes...
x Implement config file reading
	* offloaded to pyfex
	* fex only uses command line parameters
	* this makes porting across platforms easier
		* at least for me: I have no idea where a Win user would keep config files.
