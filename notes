BIN SIZE:

No detectable difference in FE score using different window length or hop values,
which is *very* good.  The score does not seem to be very dependent on configuration
parameters, but rather on the signal itself.

Some values for window length, however, make very ugly spectrograms that are hard to
work with.  256 samples make very good spectrograms, which is likely why it is the default
setting in many spectrographic software tools.  With a 44.1KHz sampling rate, 5ms happens
to be close to this value (221), and produces good spectrograms.  But with a 22.05KHz
sample rate, a window length based on 5ms uses 110 samples - which leads to ugly
spectrograms that are hard to work with interactively.

The sample rate at which a signal is recorded should not have a substantial impact on the
resulting FE score, provided that the rate is sufficient.  Using a 5ms standard will result
in window lengths that are highly dependent on the sampling rate of the input signal, and thus
may impact how effectively a user can isolate the signal in the spectrogram.

Using a consistent 256 sample window length, in contrast, should produce more consistent
results independent of sample rate, and is close to the 5ms bin size for 44.1KHz recordings.

THRESHOLD:
-24dB is too low
