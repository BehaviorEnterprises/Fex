.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
Fex
is a bioacoustic analysis tool for calculating the frequency 
excursion of an audio recording of bird songs or other sound waves. 
.PP
Fex\-gtk
is a wrapper script for fex that facilitates batch 
processing of large numbers of wave files. Fex\-gtk
can be 
provided a list of file names, or can be run with no parameters to 
provide a dialog window to select input wave files. Fex
will be 
run on each input file, and the results can either be stored to a data 
file or displayed in a dialog window upon completion. 
.PP
Fex\-gtk
is also the executable target of fex.desktop
to 
allow for drag\-and\-drop operation of fex\&.
The desktop file can 
accept any number of wave files as a drop target. 
.PP
.SH OPTIONS

.PP
.TP
\fB\-l\fP|\fB\-\-long\fP
 Provide three column output specifying the path length, path 
duration, and frequency excursion (calculated as path length over 
duration). Default is to provide only the frequency excursion value. 
.TP
\fB\-h\fP|\fB\-\-help\fP
 Print help message and exit. 
.TP
\fB\-v\fP|\fB\-\-version\fP
 Print version information and exit.

.SH CONFIGURATION

Fex
is configured via a runtime configuration file read from one 
of 
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fex/config,
$HOME/.config/fex/config,
$HOME/.fexrc,
or 
/usr/share/fex/config\&.
.PP
Read the example configuration file at /usr/share/fex/config
for 
a complete description of the available options. Those listed below are 
only the most likely to be changed. Settings not listed below should be 
changed only with caution. 
.PP

.PP
The options below are configured with the following format: 
.PP
\fBset\fP
\fIoption\fP

.PP
.TP
\fBthreshold\fP
 Amplitude at which points can be considered part of the signal 
in dB below the maximum amplitude. 
.TP
\fBfloor\fP
 Sound floor for the spectrogram display 
in dB below the maximum amplitude. 
.TP
\fBbandpass\fP
 Hi pass and low pass filter values in kHz.

.SS COLORS
.PP
Colors are configured with the following format where each setting is a 
floating point value between 0.00 and 1.00:
