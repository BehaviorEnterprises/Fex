.SH NAME

.PP
Fex
\- The frequency excursion calculator 
.PP
.SH DESCRIPTION

.PP
Fex
is a bioacoustic analysis tool for calculating the frequency 
excursion of an audio recording of bird songs or other sound waves. 
.PP
.SH FEX\-GTK

.PP
Fex\-gtk
is a wrapper script for fex that facilitates batch 
processing of large numbers of wave files. Fex\-gtk
can be 
provided a list of file names, or can be run with no parameters to 
provide a dialog window to select input wave files. Fex
will be 
run on each input file, and the results can either be stored to a data 
file or displayed in a dialog window upon completion. 
.PP
Fex\-gtk
is also the executable target of fex.desktop
to 
allow for drag\-and\-drop operation of fex\&.
The desktop file can 
accept any number of wave files as a drop target. 
.PP
.SH CONFIGURATION

Fex
is configured via a runtime configuration file read from one 
of 
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fex/config,
$HOME/.config/fex/config,
$HOME/.fexrc,
or 
/usr/share/fex/config\&.
.PP

only the most likely to be changed. Settings not listed below should be 
changed only with caution.
