2016.02.16 SFML branch is now minimally functional but not feature complete,
well tested, or at all documented.  The brave are free to tinker with it.
Anyone with experience building for Windows is invited to fix my massively
broken windows Makefile(s).

2016.01.10 Branch created to test SFML.  This branch is not yet ready for use.
Please use Master branch.
