# FEX

**Fex** - *Frequency Excursion Calculator*

<span color="red">Do not use this branch!</span>

This testing branch is for sharing between development computers only.  There is
nothing useful here.  The linux version will compile, but will fail miserably if
you do anything other than provide one wave file on the command line.  If you do
provide one wave file, it will create a spectrogram, and do virtual nothing else
of value.  The windows build will not yet build.

Update, the windows version now runs to the same degree as the linux version


## TODO

- erasing
- complete configure module
